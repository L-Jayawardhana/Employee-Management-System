# 🏢 Employee Management System (Backend) – In Progress
Hi, I'm Lakdinu, and this is a backend-only project I'm currently building using Java Spring Boot and MySQL Workbench. The goal is to create a fully functional Employee Management System as a learning and practice exercise for backend development.

  ⚠️ Note: This project is still under development. Features are being added and improved continuously.

# 🚀 What I’m Building
This system is designed to manage employees within an organization, including their roles, departments, attendance, salaries, and more. It is focused on learning best practices in backend development including:
<ul type = "disk">
  <li>Clean architecture (Controller-Service-Repository</li>
  <li>RESTful API design</li>
  <li>Spring Boot + MySQL integration</li>
  <li>Proper validations and exception handling</li>
  <li>Secure authentication & role-based access control</li>
</ul>

# 🔧 Tech Stack
<ul type = "disk">
  <li>Backend Framework: Java Spring Boot</li>
  <li>Database: MySQL (using MySQL Workbench)</li>
  <li>Authentication: (Planned) JWT-based login system</li>
  <li>Build Tool: Maven</li>
  <li>IDE: IntelliJ IDEA</li>
</ul>
  
# 📦 Features (Planned / In Progress)
<ul type = "disk">
  <li>Employee CRUD operations</li>
  <li>Department management</li>
  <li>Role-based access (Admin, HR, Employee)</li>

  <li>Email notifications</li>
</ul>
